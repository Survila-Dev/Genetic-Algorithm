# Genetic Algorithm by Eimantas Survila

This repository entails a generic genetic algorithm library with testing suite.

## What is genetic algorithm?

Genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic which is inspired by the evolution.

The optimization is facilitated by different operations which are applied to a number of candidates in accordance to their fitness. Through application of elitism (some candidates go directly to the next generation), mutation and crossover a next generation of candidates is generated.

The further definition and detailed description can be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) and on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3#:~:text=A%20genetic%20algorithm%20is%20a,offspring%20of%20the%20next%20generation.).

## Guide to using the library

The library was developed with [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and the testing suite depicts how the library can be used.
