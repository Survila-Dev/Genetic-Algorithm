# Genetic Algorithm by Eimantas Survila

This repository entails a generic genetic algorithm library with testing suite.

## What is genetic algorithm?

Genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic which is inspired by the evolution. The optimization is facilitated by different operations which are applied to a number of candidates. After the first group of candidates (the first generation) was seeded/randomly generated and their fitness estimated, various operations like elitism (some candidates go directly to the next generation), mutation and crossover are applied to generate the next generation. Consequently, the next generation undergoes the same routine and in such iterative approach the search space is explored.

Further detailed description of genetic algorithm can be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) and on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3#:~:text=A%20genetic%20algorithm%20is%20a,offspring%20of%20the%20next%20generation.).

## Guide to using the library

The library was developed with [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and the testing suite depicts how the library can be used.
